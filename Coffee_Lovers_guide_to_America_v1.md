# Coffee Lovers guide to America

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

Coffee first became popular in the U.S. after the Boston Tea Party, when the switch was seen as “patriotic,” according to PBS[link](https://www.example.com/my%20great%20page). And since Starbucks debuted in 1971, the drink is now accessible almost anywhere you go. A recent survey by the National Coffee Association found that 62 percent of Americans drink coffee every day, with the average coffee drinker consuming 3 cups daily.
What gave way to java culture? Science, for one, has convinced us that caffeine possesses multiple health benefits besides mental stimulation. At the right dosages, caffeine may contribute to longevity. Perhaps just as important, though, is coffee’s social purpose. Today, coffee stations are a staple of the workplace, and tens of thousands of shops serve as meeting places for friends, dates and coworkers – though in 2020 many have had to provide take-out service only due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Business Problem

To determine the best city for coffee lovers, we will find neighborhoods with the highest density of coffee shops in five major US cities.

## Data

We will use the FourSquare API to fetch data about locations of coffee shops in following 5 largest US cities: 
 -	New York City, NY (Population: 8,622,357)
 -	Los Angeles, CA (Population: 4,085,014)
 -	Chicago, IL (Population: 2,670,406)
